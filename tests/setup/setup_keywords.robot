...              DEFAULT MODE: Dev mode - keeps containers running for fast iteration
...
...              This file provides two primary modes:
...              - Dev Mode (default): Reuse containers, clear data only (~5s)
...              - Prod Mode: Complete teardown and rebuild (for CI/CD)
...
...              Control via environment variables:
...              - TEST_MODE: 'dev' (default) or 'prod' (CI/CD mode)
...              - REBUILD: Force container rebuild (dev mode only)
...
...              Quick usage:
...              - robot tests/                    # Dev mode (fast, keep containers)
...              - TEST_MODE=prod robot tests/     # Prod mode (CI/CD, fresh env)
