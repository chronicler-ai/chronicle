# Chronicle Docker Compose - Application Services
# This file contains only the application layer
#
# ⚠️ Prerequisites: Infrastructure must be running first!
#
# Recommended workflow:
#   ./quick-start.sh              # First time (handles everything)
#   make up                       # Daily use (auto-starts infra if needed)
#
# Direct docker compose (manual):
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d  # Start infra first
#   docker compose up -d                              # Then start app
#   docker compose down                               # Stop app only
#
# Environment:
#   Uses .env.default (auto-generated by ./quick-start.sh)
